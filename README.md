## REPOSITORY TO SEE SORTBY AND GROUPBY FUNCTIONS IN PANDAS.
## This can be seen as practise to SORTBY AND GROUPBY FUNCTIONS in pandas with the following queries.
### Groupby 
    1. we see the average beer consumption acrosss the world.  
    2. we use the drinks.csv dataset and groupby function to see beer served across all continents.
